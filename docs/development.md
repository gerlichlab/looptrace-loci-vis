## Development
First, please refer to the general [installation and environment](./README.md#installation-and-environment).

By default, with `nix-shell`, you should have all the dependencies you'll need not only to _use_ this plugin, but also to _develop_ on it. 
In other words, dependencies to do things like run tests, run linter(s), and run type checking should all be provided. 
If you try and that's not the case, please check the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gerlichlab/looptrace-loci-vis/issues).
If an issue's open for what you're experiencing, please upvote the initial description of the issue and/or comment on the ticket.

### Testing, formatting, and linting
The various tests run against the project can be found in the [GitHub actions workflows](../.github/workflows/).
